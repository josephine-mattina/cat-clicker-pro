# Project Overview

Extending the Cat Clicker mini project for the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree by adding an Admin mode to the application and continuing to use the MVC pattern within javascript.


## How to run the application

Clone or download the [repo](https://github.com/josephine-mattina/cat-clicker) and open `index.html` in a web browser.


## How to play Cat Clicker Pro

1. Five cat names are displayed. Click on a cat name to load the image of the cat.
2. Click on the image of the cat to increase the number of clicks shown below the image. 
3. Select a different cat name and repeat step 2.
4. Repeat as many times as you like!

The number of clicks for each cat will be saved until the page is reloaded.


## Special features:

Cat Clicker Pro includes an `Admin` mode so you can add your own cats to the application!

To **add a new cat**, select the `Admin` button to load the form and fill in all the information. Click `Save` and your cat name will appear listed after the original cat names. Click the name to display your cat and play as normal.

Press the **cancel** button to hide the form.

**Your custom loaded cats will only be saved until the page is reloaded.**
